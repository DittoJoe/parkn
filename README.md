### What can I do here?

- See a park's [details](https://www.parkn.club/parks/75) and add a review
- Save a park to your [dashboard](https://www.parkn.club/bookmarks)

### What are those buttons under the park's picture? ðŸ¤”

Here you can see what facilities a park has and vote yourself. That way, others will know what this park has (and what it doesn't). But remember - you can only vote for each option once! *Not sure what the icons stand for? Try hovering over the button!*

*Note: you will have to sign up the first time you use the website, but don't worry - this is just so you can save your favourite parks and leave a review.*
